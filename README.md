 Compilation of my school projects for HTML and CSS

Project Filefolders

This page is an example for a Spave travel company.  Its stylized using CSS and contgains a nav bar, image containers and a form.

 - Cinemas

This page is an example home page for a movie theater that is stylized using Boostrap 4. It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.

 - Onepage website

This is a page created from the Space Station template but customized with my own pictures and styling

The rest of the folders is a compliation of all my school projects to date for HTML, CSS and Bostrap.



I leave the chaos as a reminder of what not to do and to be more organized with my repositories going forward. 

Things to remember, notation of code while writing it to section projects and let others know what section of code is about, orgazize projects in a folder system that is clear and understandable to myself and others.
